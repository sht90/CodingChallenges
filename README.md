# Coding Challenges

This repo is inspired by Daniel Shiffman and the many [coding challenges](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17WoOqgXsRM&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZiZxtDDRCi6uhfTH4FilpH) he does on his YouTube channel [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCodingTrain/featured). I hope to make one-off projects with a similar size, scope, and style. Though I don't intend to devote myself to any one language.

I basically want to explore algorithms and data structures for their own sake, not just because I need them for a specific application.
